This is my 4th Task in SkillCraft Technologies Web Development Internship.
I created a To-Do web application that allows users to add, organize, and manage tasks, including marking them as completed, editing, and setting due dates.
The app is styled with CSS, while JavaScript handles the functionality for an intuitive and interactive experience.
